In the Summer of 2024, I will continue to study Python. First, I will review what I learned in the Spring using a Udemy course. Then, I will be learning about lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. I also plan to learn more about exceptions, objects, and classes. If time permits, I want to practice other data structures. 

Furthermore, the Udemy course has many guides to different libraries, including turle, pandas, and tkinter.

Please see the following directories for my plans of self-study over summer 2024:
- 'classes_objects: [6]
- 'dictionaries': [5]
- 'lists': includes lists, nested lists/arrays
- 'projects' 
- 'review': includes basic syntax, variables, data types, branching, loops, functions; includes the random library
- 'sets':
- 'tuples':
