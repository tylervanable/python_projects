In the Summer of 2024, I will continue to study Python. First, I will review what I learned in the Spring using a Udemy course. Then, I will be learning about lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. I also plan to learn more about exceptions, objects, and classes. If time permits, I want to practice other data structures.
