# List Programs

Here is a collection of projects that require the use of lists:

- 'lists_appending': demonstrate list appending by adding "Puerto Rico" into our list of US state admission; then remove "Puerto Rico" from the list; finally demonstrate .extend([]) to add multiple (imaginary) states into our list of US states
- 'lists_primer': discusses basic syntax of lists (ordered, mutable); utilizes a list of US states by their admission date in the Union; demonstrates how to access a particular list item through index positions, both positive and negative indexes; also demonstrates how to assign a list item with a new value
