# List Programs

Here is a collection of projects that require the use of lists:

- 'RPS_game2': program that improves upon the rock, paper, scissors game included in my review directory; utilizes a list to store ASCII game images; also utilizes more robuts game logic
- 'index_errors': discusses the len() function, IndexErrors, and how to avoid IndexErrors when trying to access list items where the index does not exist
- 'lists_methods': append "Puerto Rico" into our list of US state admission; then remove "Puerto Rico" from the list; finally demonstrate the .extend([]) method to add multiple (imaginary) states into our list of US states
- 'lists_methods2': remove the Wii U from a chronological list of Nintendo consoles by release date; also insert the Switch console to the list; then sort the Nintendo consoles in alphabetical order; then make a copy of the original list
- 'lists_primer': discusses basic syntax of lists (ordered, mutable); utilizes a list of US states by their admission date in the Union; demonstrates how to access a particular list item through index positions, both positive and negative indexes; also demonstrates how to assign a list item with a new value
- 'nested_list': demonstrates a nested list of the 'dirty_dozen', the crops that are commercialized with the most pesticides; also demonstrates accessing items within a nested list through two indicies (the first index, indicating the list, the second index, indicating the list item)
- 'restaurant_roulette': demonstrates accessing list items, names; utilizes the random library to decide who will be paying for the bill amongst a group of friends and/or family members
- 'treasure_map': program that allows user to input map coordinates to "bury" treasure on a 3x3 grid; users input coordinates with a letter and number and the grid is displayed with the  "buried" treasure indicated by an 'X'. There is a list of letters to determine the column index
