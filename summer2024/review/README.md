Scripts in this directory are adapted from Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp".

The following scripts are review for Python syntax, variables, basic data types, IPO programs, branching (conditionals), loops, and functions:
- 'add_digits_two_digit': program that requests a two digit number from the user and displays the sum of those individual digits; utilizes indexing of a variable
- 'band_name': program that asks the user for a city and a name of a pet; it then displays a sample band name to the user
- 'bmi_calc_udemy': BMI calculator that requests that user's height in meters and weight in kilograms then displays their BMI
- 'data_type_ex': program that demonstrates indexing a variable of the string data type; also demonstrates the use of underscores in place of commas for large numbers
- 'f_strings': program that demonstrates the use of displaying text with two different variable types using the f-string
- 'num_manipulation': program that demonstrates how casting can impact data types in Python
- 'rollercoaster_height': branching program that requests the user's height in centimeters and prints a message depending on if the user is able to ride a rollercoaster
- 'tip_calc': program that calculates the cost of a meal for each person; the user inputs the cost of the meal, what percentage tip they want to give, and between how many people the bill will be split (MY program that I wrote without any additional aid)
- 'tip_calc2': same program as the prior the tip calculator, but adapted from the Udemy course program that Dr. Yu provided
- 'type_errors_ex': program that discusses the TypeError
- 'weeks_left': a program that asks the user for their age, and calculates how many weeks the user has to live given that they live for 90 years.
