Scripts in this directory are adapted from Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp".

The following scripts are review for Python syntax, variables, basic data types, IPO programs, branching (conditionals), loops, and functions:
- 'add_digits_two_digit': program that requests a two digit number from the user and displays the sum of those individual digits
- 'band_name': program that asks the user for a city and a name of a pet; it then displays a sample band name to the user
- 'bmi_calc_udemy': BMI calculator that requests that user's height and weight and displays their BMI

- 'f_strings': program that demonstrates the use of displaying text with two different variable types using the f-string
- 'num_manipulation': program that demonstrates how casting can impact data types in Python
- 'rollercoaster_height': branching program that requests the user's height in centimeters and prints a message depending on if the user is able to ride a rollercoaster
