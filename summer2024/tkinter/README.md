# Introductory tkinter projects

The following tkinter projects demonstrate how to display a window and pack text on the screen:
* 'tkinter_pack': project that displays text packed to middle-left side of the window
* 'tkinter_pack2': project that displays text packed to the very center of the window
* 'tkinter_window': project that displays a basic tkinter window with no text
