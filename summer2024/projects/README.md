# Selected Projects
The following projects are practical applications of real-world problems. I hope you can use and enjoy these programs:
- 'game_recommendation': program which allows users to add games to a list; a randomly generated number is chosen to select and display a random game to the user
- 'pass_gen': program which displays to the users a randomly generated password; utilizes .random.choice() and .shuffle() to randomize the password characters
- 'pass_gen2' program which displays to the users a semi-randomly generated password, without the .shuffle() method, for a password that contains first letters, then numbers, then characters.
