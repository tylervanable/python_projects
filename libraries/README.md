# Overview
Python is very versatile in the quantity and quality of libraries available. I have projects utilizing the following interesting libraries:
- 'nltk': The Natural Language Toolkit. Used to work with human language data, particularly in English.
- 'ytmusicapi': YT Music API. Used to navigate the YouTube Music streaming service. I am using it to learn more about data structures.
