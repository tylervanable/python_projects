# Overview
Python is very versatile in the quantity and quality of libraries available. I have projects utilizing the following interesting libraries:
- 'nltk': The Natural Language Toolkit. Used to work with human language data, particularly in English.
- 'os.path': used for checking if a file name exists. I have used the os.path.isfile(file_name) function.
- 'typing': used for type hints. As of yet, I have used it for the "typing.TextIO" data type when reading text files. 
- 'ytmusicapi': YT Music API. Used to navigate the YouTube Music streaming service. I am using it to learn more about data structures.
