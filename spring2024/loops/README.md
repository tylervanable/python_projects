# Overview

Here is a list of the various projects utilizing repetition or loops in python:

- 'age_average_sentinel': an IPO program that requests ages from the user, and averages the ages. Uses a sentinel loop, so that when the user enters '-1', the program will average the ages.
- 'bacon_proximity'
- 'congress_info_process': program that will read and process information from a text file called "congress.txt". The "congress.txt" file must include sets of information in the following pattern: state name, number of representatives, population, and state abbreviation. Utilizes io library to annotate a variable to a TextIOWrapper. 
- 'deck_of_cards': program that will loop and display through all 52 cards in a standard playing card deck. Utilizes a nested loop; the outer loop determines the suit, while the inner loop determines the card type. 
- 'leibniz_pi_approximation': an IPO program that requests how many terms of pi/4 the user wants to approximate, and uses a loop and accumulator variable that will display the approximation to the user.
- 'longest_name': an IPO program that obtains five names from the user, determines whether the user's name is longer than the most-wanted-holder variable, and displays the longest name with the most amount of characters. Uses Python's built-in len() function. Also utilizes the sys library to initially assign the most-wanted-holder variable to the smallest possible number. 
- 'process_names': a program that reads, processes, and displays in the IDLE a list of names. Requires a text file called "names.txt" to function.
- 'read_race_results' program that opens a text file and determines the winner of the race for two age brackets
- 'video_game_clock': an IPO program that requests how many minutes of video games the user played every day for four weeks, then displays that amount in minutes to the user. Utilizes an accumulator variable to store the total minutes of video games played over 28 days.
- 'video_game_clock_weekly': an IPO program that requests how many minutes of video games the user played every day for four weeks, then displays the amount of minutes the user played each week and in total to the user. Utilizes a accumulator variable to store the total minutes of video games played each week and over the span of four weeks.
