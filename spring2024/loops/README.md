# Overview

Here is a list of the various projects utilizing repetition or loops in python:

- 'age_average_sentinel.py' - an IPO program that requests ages from the user, and averages the ages. Uses a sentinel loop, so that when the user enters '-1', the program will average the ages. 
- 'deck_of_cards.py' - program that will loop and display through all 52 cards in a standard playing card deck. Utilizes a nested loop; the outer loop determines the suit, while the inner loop determines the card type. 
- 'leibniz_pi_approximation.py' - an IPO program that requests how many terms of pi/4 the user wants to approximate, and uses a loop and accumulator variable that will display the approximation to the user.
- 'video_game_clock.py' - an IPO program that requests how many minutes of video games the user played every day for four weeks, then displays that amount in minutes to the user. Utilizes an accumulator variable to store the total minutes of video games played over 28 days.
