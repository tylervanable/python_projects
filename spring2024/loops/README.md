# Overview

Here is a list of the various projects utilizing repetition or loops in python:

- 'age_average_sentinel.py' - an IPO program that requests ages from the user, and averages the ages. Uses a sentinel loop, so that when the user enters '-1', the program will average the ages. 
- 'leibniz_pi_approximation.py' - an IPO program that requests how many terms of pi/4 the user wants to approximate, and uses a loop and accumulator variable that will display the approximation to the user.
