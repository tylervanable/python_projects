# Branching Problems
The following are branching programs, some using the random library:
* 'day_of_week_import': very basic program that utilizes the datetime library to display the date. 
* 'dog_food_schedule': IPO program that requests a time from the user, and gives the user a reminder to feed their dog, depending on the time of day. 
* 'favorite_beatle': IPO program that requests the user's favorite member of the Beatles, then outputs a personalized message depending on the user's choice. An example of a series-if program (if-elif-else structure)
* 'favorite_beatle_upper': IPO program that builds off the last program, but uses Python's built-in upper function to increase user input options.
* 'leap_year_calc': IPO program that requests a year from the user, then determines whether the year is a leap year or is not a leap year.
* 'nested_pet_preference': IPO program that asks the user questions regarding what pet they should own. Depending on user input, a personalized message about the pet is displayed to the user. 
* 'pizza_n_tacos': IPO program that requests a number of pizzas and tacos. Uses 'if-elif-else' structure to compare the two numbers. Outputs include whether there are more pizzas than tacos, more tacos than pizzas, or an equal amount of pizzas and tacos.
* * 'planet_weight': IPO program that requests a weight and planet from the user. It uses branching to calculate the weight.
* 'quiz1_final_grade_calc': IPO program that requests a grade for a quiz, given that the quiz is worth 30% of their final grade, and determines how many points the student lost on their final grade.
* 'voting_age': IPO program that asks the user for their age, and displays whether the user is old enough to vote in the United States.
