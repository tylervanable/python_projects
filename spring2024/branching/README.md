# Branching Problems
The following are branching programs, some using the random library:
* 'day_of_week_import':
* 'dog_food_schedule': 
* 'favorite_beatle': IPO program that requests the user's favorite member of the Beatles, then outputs a personalized message depending on the user's choice. An example of a series-if program (if-elif-else structure)
* 'leap_year_calc':
* 'nested_pet_preference'
* 'planet_weight': IPO program that requests a weight and planet from the user. It uses branching to calculate the weight.
* 'pizza_n_tacos': IPO program that requests a number of pizzas and tacos. Uses 'if-elif-else' structure to compare the two numbers. Outputs include whether there are more pizzas than tacos, more tacos than pizzas, or an equal amount of pizzas and tacos.
* 'quiz1_final_grade_calc'
* 'voting_age'
