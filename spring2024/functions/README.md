# Functions
The following python programs utilize functions:

- 'area_triangle_three_times': IPO program that asks the user for the base and height three times using a 'for-loop'. The program displays the area of these triangles to the user.
- 'calc_calories_from_fat': IPO program that asks the user for how many fat grams they consumed today and calculates and displays the number of calories the user gained
- 'calc_shapes_area': IPO program in which the user can choose between a square, rectangle, triangle or circle; the program will calculate the area of the user's shape and display the area.
- 'car_expenses':
- 'check_letter': program that invokes a function called 'is_letter' that validates whether 12 test characters are of one character length and if the character is a letter; displays validation 6 True and 6 False characters, True meaning a letter and False meaning a non-letter
- 'convert_pounds_kilogram': IPO program that asks the user for an amount of pounds and converts this value to kilograms. 
- 'factorial': IPO program that asks user for a value 'n' and determines the factorial amount of 'n' [n!].
- 'falling_distance': IPO program that obtains the falling time from the user, calculates the falling distance of the user's object, and displays the distance fallen
- 'guessing_game': program that prompts the user to pick a number between 1 and 100. Uses an accumulator variable to count how many guesses the user makes before guessing correctly. 
- 'read_and_print_function'
- 'rect_area_length': program that requests the length and width from the user and outputs the area. 
- 'validate_sodoku_string': program that invokes a function called 'is_valid' that checks whether 12 test strings contain 9 characters, with exactly one '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', and '9'; displays validation of 6 True and 6 False strings, True meaning the string is a valid sodoku string combination, False meaning the string is not a valid sodoku string combination
- 'validate_yes_or_no': program that invokes a function called 'is_valid' that checks whether 12 test strings that the user enters is either 'yes' or 'no', ignoring case; displays validation of 6 True and 6 False strings, True meaning the string is either 'yes' or 'no' ignoring case, False meaning the string is not 'yes' or 'no' ignoring case
