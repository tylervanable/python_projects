"""
    Calculate the area of a triangle for the user three times.
    Write a function that takes a triangleâ€™s base and height as (parameter) input and returns the area.

    Function calculate_area will calculate the area of a triangle and return to main.
    Function main is where execution begins. Inputs are obtained from the user and the
    calculate_area function is called three times. Three different areas are displayed
    to the user.
