# Turtle Programs
The following programs demonstrate use of Python's turtle library to graphically demonstrate flow of control and program state:
- 'blue_octagon.py' was my attempt at using the turtle documentation to test a different program state. I noticed the shape was off-center, so began working on the position of the lines.
- 'turtle_tic_tac_toe,py' was my attempt to plan the Cartesian coordinates before developing a program. I wanted to center the hash shape around the origin of the turtle display.
- 'stacked_rectangles.py' was a textbook problem from "Problem Solving with Python" by Margaret Burke.
